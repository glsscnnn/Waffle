This program is incredibly overkill at the moment essentially this is an idea based off of [this](https://daleonai.com/pdf-to-audiobook) post which uses a variety
of google cloud technologies to acheive an automated system of audio books from pdfs.

I was able to do the same thing with 3 commands so I just put it into a script like a nerd. Theoreticlly this could be the best aproach I just need to figure out
how to clean the text file after I converted the pdf.
