# The Linux Aproach

Using pre-existing tools I was able to achieve essentially the same result in like 2 seconds using zero ML.

the deps here are espeak (tts) and pdf2text, which converts pdf files into plaintext. 

I understand that this approach is pretty dogshit compared to the using ML, but this approach is simple and works.

You could also use festival(tts) but instead of creating the file in 2 sec it would take however long it takes for festival to read it but festival sounds much better than espeak.
